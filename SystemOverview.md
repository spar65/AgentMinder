# System Overview

Agent Minder is a comprehensive agent management and payment processing platform built on a modern Node.js/TypeScript architecture. The system provides a complete solution for managing independent agents, tracking their activities, processing commissions and payments, and supporting various business operations through a secure, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technology Stack

#### Backend Framework:
- Node.js (v16.0+) runtime environment
- Express.js (v4.18.2) for RESTful API implementation
- TypeScript (v5.3.3) for type-safe code development
- MongoDB (compatible with v5.0+) database with Mongoose ODM (v8.1.1) for data persistence

#### Authentication & Security:
- JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication system
- bcrypt (v5.1.0) for password hashing
- Helmet.js for HTTP header security
- Express-rate-limit for API request throttling
- CORS protection with configurable domain allowances

#### Payment Processing:
- Stripe API integration (v2023-10-16 or newer)
- Support for multiple payment methods including credit cards, ACH transfers, and digital wallets
- Webhook implementation for asynchronous payment event handling
- Idempotent transaction processing to prevent duplicate charges
- PCI-compliant payment flow with tokenization

#### Database & Data Models:
- Normalized MongoDB schema design with Mongoose
- Compound and text-based indexes for optimized query performance
- Mongoose middleware for data validation and business rule enforcement
- Transactions support for multi-document operations
- TTL indexes for automated data cleanup where applicable

#### Logging & Monitoring:
- Winston (v3.11.0) for structured logging with multiple transport options
- Log rotation and retention policies
- Environment-specific log levels (production vs. development)
- Error tracking and notification system

#### Code Quality & Testing:
- Jest testing framework with coverage reporting
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality standards
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Husky git hooks for pre-commit quality checks

- Multi-currency support with exchange rate management
- Payment splitting capabilities for shared commissions
- Automated commission disbursements to agents via Stripe Connect
- Comprehensive payment lifecycle management (pending, processing, completed, failed, refunded)
- Idempotent payment operations to prevent duplicates
- Payment event webhooks for real-time status updates
- Detailed transaction history and receipt generation
- Stripe PaymentIntent and PaymentMethod API integration for SCA compliance
- Refund and adjustment processing with approval workflows

#### 3. API Layer
RESTful API design implementing industry best practices:
- Versioned API endpoints (/api/v1/)
- Consistent response formatting for success and error states
- JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Pagination, sorting, and filtering for all list endpoints
- Hypermedia links (HATEOAS) for API discoverability
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation
- API key management for system integrations
- Middleware-based request processing pipeline

#### 4. System Architecture Features
- Modular, maintainable codebase with separation of concerns
- Service-oriented architecture for business logic encapsulation

### Data Security & Compliance
- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
- GDPR-ready data handling with consent tracking
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII) protection mechanisms
- Data retention policies with automated enforcement
- Role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Audit trails for all sensitive operations
- Secure credential storage with encryption
- XSS and CSRF attack prevention
- SQL injection protection

### Integration Capabilities
