# Development Practices for Agent Minder

This document outlines the development best practices to be followed when working on the Agent Minder project.

## Code Quality

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code to ensure type safety
- Configure strict mode in `tsconfig.json`
- Define explicit types for function parameters and return values
- Use interfaces for complex object shapes
- Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary

### Coding Style

- Follow the ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Use async/await instead of callbacks or raw Promises
- Avoid deep nesting of conditionals and loops

## Architecture

### Project Structure

- Follow the established directory structure:
  - `/src`: Source code
    - `/config`: Configuration files
    - `/controllers`: API route handlers
    - `/middleware`: Express middleware
    - `/models`: Database models
    - `/routes`: API routes
    - `/services`: Business logic
    - `/utils`: Utility functions
    - `/types`: TypeScript type definitions
  - `/tests`: Test files
    - `/unit`: Unit tests
    - `/integration`: Integration tests
  - `/docs`: Documentation

### Separation of Concerns

- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- Services: Implement business logic
- Models: Define data structure and database interaction
- Routes: Define API endpoints
- Middleware: Process requests before they reach the route handlers
- Utils: Provide utility functions used across the application

## Testing

### Test-Driven Development

- Write tests before implementing new features when possible
- Maintain high test coverage (aim for at least 80%)
- Test the public API of modules, not implementation details

### Test Types

- Unit Tests: Test individual functions and classes in isolation
- Integration Tests: Test the interaction between components
- API Tests: Test the API endpoints from the outside

### Testing Best Practices

- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies
- Keep tests independent of each other
- Avoid test duplication

## Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Next release development
- Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
- Bug fix branches: `fix/bug-name`
- Release branches: `release/version`

### Commit Messages

- Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:
  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation only changes
  - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
  - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - `perf`: A code change that improves performance
  - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  - `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Pull Requests

- Keep pull requests small and focused on a single feature or bug fix
- Reference related issues in the pull request description
- Ensure all tests pass
- Get code reviewed by at least one other developer
- Squash commits before merging

## Error Handling

- Use a consistent error handling approach
- Utilize the custom `ApiError` class for HTTP errors
- Log errors with appropriate severity levels
- Return standardized error responses from the API
- Handle unexpected errors gracefully

## Security

- Store sensitive information in environment variables
- Validate and sanitize user input
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for production deployments
- Keep dependencies up to date to avoid security vulnerabilities
- Follow the principle of least privilege

## Performance

- Optimize database queries with appropriate indexes
- Implement pagination for list endpoints
- Use caching for expensive operations
- Monitor application performance
- Optimize your code for the critical path

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Run tests automatically on push and pull requests
- Lint code as part of the CI process
- Automate the deployment process
- Use environment-specific configurations

## Documentation

- Keep README up to date
- Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Include JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Create documentation for complex business logic
- Document setup and deployment processes

## Dependencies

- Keep dependencies to a minimum
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use exact versions in package.json
- Audit dependencies for security issues

## Monitoring and Logging

- Implement structured logging with Winston
- Include relevant context in log messages
- Use different log levels appropriately
- Monitor application health and performance
- Set up alerts for critical issues

By following these best practices, we will maintain a high-quality, maintainable, and secure codebase for the Agent Minder project.
